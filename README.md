OH NO!!

Crying Jordan is here to ruin your day!

Only the greatest basketball teams of all time can stop him!

Pick from a wide variety of ELITE basketball teams in order to stop Crying Jordan and avoid blowing a 3-1 Lead.



How to Play:
==========

Player One runs nba1.py and can select their team

Player Two runs nba2.py and waits for Player One to make their selection

Player One controls the player at the bottom of the screen using the arrow keys.  Try and catch as many basketballs as possible! Avoid catching bombs though!
Each basketball adds 1 to your score, while each bomb subtracts 1 from your score.

Player Two controls crying jordan.  Use the mouse to aim and fire at the basketballs.  Shoot down as many baseketballs as possible! Avoid shooting bombs though!
Each basketball adds 1 to your score, while each bomb subtracts 1 from your score.

The first player to get 10 basketballs is the winner!


Important Notes:
==============

Due to the way the TCP connections are set-up, nba1.py must be run before nba2.py.
